# Task_2_Exploratory-Data-Analysis-EDA-

Exploratory Data Analysis on the Titanic dataset using Python. Includes summary statistics, visualizations (histograms, boxplots, correlation matrix, pairplots), and pattern identification across passenger features to understand survival trends. Ideal for beginners practicing data science and visualization techniques.

# Titanic Data Analysis

This project explores the Titanic dataset using Python. It follows a structured EDA process to extract insights about survival rates, passenger characteristics, and feature relationships.

## Task Breakdown

1. **Summary Statistics**: Used `describe()` and `median()` to explore central tendencies and distributions.
2. **Histograms & Boxplots**: Visualized `Age` and `Fare` with respect to survival.
3. **Correlation Matrix & Pairplots**: Analyzed relationships between numeric features.
4. **Trends & Patterns**: Identified survival trends based on `Pclass`, `Sex`, `FamilySize`, and `Embarked`.
5. **Feature-Level Inferences**: Computed survival rates across groups and created `AgeGroup` insights.

## Tools Used

- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib

## Files

- `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: Original dataset
- `Task_2_Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)`: Full Python script for EDA

## Output Examples

You can find visualizations like:
- Age and Fare distribution
- Correlation heatmap
- Survival rates by different categories
